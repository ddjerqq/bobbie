A discord bot written for Georgia Community discord server.

## this code is over a year old. 
it still uses `discord.py 1.7.3` so please take it with a HUGE grain of salt. 
however! there are some things to take away from this project. aside the leaked tokens and user information hahaha (they have been reset dontworry.)
- the `Model Service Repository` pattern in the `/database`
- the service pattern
- centralized singleton client class
- localization, so much more stuff like that

### I as the creator am saying that this code sucks, so as it is not to be used as reference to my CURRENT skill.
although, it was a very fun project to work on, I did not know a lot of design patterns, and `discord.py` tricks.
